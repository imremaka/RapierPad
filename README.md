## Protos: Our flagship AI Agent

Protos is Novus DeFAI's flagship AI agent, designed to showcase the platform's advanced capabilities in autonomous yield farming on the Solana blockchain. Launched with an initial seed capital of $50,000, Protos employs a multi-strategy approach that includes yield farming, staking, arbitrage, and lending. It continuously adapts to market conditions, utilizing real-time data analysis and advanced risk management techniques to optimize returns while mitigating potential losses. Protos serves as both a benchmark for user-created AI agents and a revenue generator for the platform, with its profits being distributed to $PROTOS token holders.

Protos serves not only as a benchmark for user-created AI agents but also as a revenue generator for the platform, with profits distributed to $PROTOS token holders.

## $PROTOS Token

$PROTOS is the utility token powering the Novus DeFAI ecosystem:

- Required for AI agent deployment
- Grants access to premium features and advanced analytics
- Entitles holders to a share of platform fees
- Enables participation in future governance decisions

### Revenue Sharing Model
- Platform fees are distributed to $PROTOS holders
- Profits generated by Protos are distributed hourly
- Distribution based on the percentage of $PROTOS supply held

## Novus LaunchPad

Novus LaunchPad is the core interface of the Novus DeFAI ecosystem, where users can create and customize their own AI agents for yield farming. It offers an extensive range of parameters across three key areas: DeFi Parameters, AI Agent Parameters, and Market Analysis Parameters. These settings allow users to fine-tune their agents' behavior, from basic aspects like liquidity preference and risk tolerance to advanced features such as learning rate and market trend alignment. By providing this level of customization, Novus LaunchPad empowers users to create AI agents tailored to their specific investment strategies and risk profiles, all while leveraging the power of artificial intelligence in the DeFi space.
